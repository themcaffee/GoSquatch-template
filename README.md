# GoSquatch Starter Template

A template to build your own GoSquatch site. This template uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS for some basic stylization but it is easily replaced in your layout file with any other CSS.

Check out the GoSquatch [Documentation](https://mitchmcaffee.com/GoSquatch/) on how to use this or check out the [site](https://mitchmcaffee.com/GoSquatch-template/) built by this template!
